      title="About Me"
      description=`Hello 👋 I am a Senior Android Engineer and Team Leader with over 7 years of experience developing mobile applications. I love working with Android and always look for ways to make apps fast, stable, and easy to maintain. Over the years, I’ve learned to optimize development, use tools that make it easier, and improve the team’s workflow.
        
        I’ve had the opportunity to lead projects and teams, and one of my main goals is always to ensure the team is aligned, motivated, and focused on delivering the best work. Android development is my passion, and I’m excited by how we can create incredible user experiences.
        
        I’m always looking to learn new things and collaborate on projects that help me grow as a developer.
